In the following document, we perform principal component analysis of the `datasets::mtcars` data. Please note: this is not my own original code. I used this as a practice for setting up my website. It's also a helpful example of PCA, though, so I'm keeping it on here in hopes others can access & use it as a reference. Original code & helpful tutorial can be found [here]( https://plot.ly/r/github-getting-started-for-data-scientists/#chapter-4-version-control-r-code-using-an-example-of-pca).

# Introducing the `mtcars` dataset

Here is the actual dataset

```{r, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(mtcars)
```

And here are the summary statistics for each variable

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```



# Principal Component Analysis on the `mtcars` dataset

```{r}
# cor = TRUE indicates that PCA is performed on 
# standardized data (mean = 0, variance= 1)
pcaCars <- princomp(mtcars, cor = TRUE)

# view objects stored in pcaCars
names(pcaCars)

# proportion of variance explained
summary(pcaCars)
```

## Visulation of the PCs

```{r}
# bar plot
plot(pcaCars)

# scree plot
plot(pcaCars, type = "l")

```


# Cluster Analysis Using PCA Scores

First we cluster the cars using hierarchical clustering

```{r}
# cluster cars
carsHC <- hclust(dist(pcaCars$scores), method = "ward.D2")

# dendrogram
plot(carsHC)

```


## Cutting the Dendrogram

```{r}
# cut the dendrogram into 3 clusters
carsClusters <- cutree(carsHC, k = 3)

# draw dendogram with red borders around the 3 clusters 
plot(carsHC)
rect.hclust(carsHC, k=3, border="red")
```


## First 2 PCs with Cluster Membership

```{r}
# add cluster to data frame of scores
carsDf <- data.frame(pcaCars$scores, "cluster" = factor(carsClusters))
str(carsDf)

# plot the first 2 PCs with cluster membership
# need to install ggplot2 and ggrepel packages first
# using the following command in R: 
# install.packages(c("ggplot2","ggrepel"))
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(carsDf,aes(x=Comp.1, y=Comp.2)) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = rownames(carsDf))) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "gray70") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "gray70") +
  geom_point(aes(color = cluster), alpha = 0.55, size = 3) +
  xlab("PC1") +
  ylab("PC2") + 
  xlim(-5, 6) + 
  ggtitle("PCA plot of Cars")
```
